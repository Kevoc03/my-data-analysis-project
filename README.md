🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis Project
📊 Project Overview

This project explores trends in medical conditions, patient demographics, and healthcare services using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis aims to identify prevalent medical conditions, patterns in healthcare utilization, and potential correlations between patient attributes and health outcomes.
📂 Dataset

    Source: Kaggle Healthcare Dataset

    Contents:

        Patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)

        Medical conditions and diagnoses

        Treatment history and healthcare services utilized

🔍 Analysis Performed

    Data Cleaning:

        Handled missing values

        Standardized data formats

        Removed duplicates

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

        Identified the most common medical conditions

        Visualized patient distribution based on demographics

    Feature Correlation:

        Created a correlation matrix to analyze relationships between variables

        Visualized correlations using a heatmap

    Predictive Modeling (if applicable):

        Built a machine learning model (if implemented) to predict health outcomes based on patient attributes

📈 Results & Insights

    The top 10 most common medical conditions were identified and visualized using bar charts.

    A correlation heatmap was generated to examine the relationships between patient characteristics and medical conditions.

    (If applicable) A predictive model was tested to analyze potential risk factors for specific conditions.
